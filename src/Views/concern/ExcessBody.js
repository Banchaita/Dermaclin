                                All women have body &amp; facial hair.&nbsp; Normal hair is generally light &amp; fine in
                                texture.&nbsp; Excessive body &amp; facial hair is darker &amp; course in texture.&nbsp;
                                Excessive body hair is a problem that is quite a pain to deal with. And not only is the
                                removal of this hair an exasperating &amp; time-consuming affair but it can also damage your
                                skin in the long run. Chemical removal of hair or constant waxing &amp; shaving can damage
                                the outer layer of your skin giving it an unpleasant hue &amp; appearance and also damage
                                its texture &amp; tone.
                            </p>
                            <p>The presence of excess body hair can lead to feelings of self-consciousness. However, the
                                hormonal imbalance that can lead to it, may compromise a womanâ€™s health &amp; therefore
                                needs to be treated
